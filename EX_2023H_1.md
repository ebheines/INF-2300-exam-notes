## T1.1
Application layer:
The application layer is responsible for the client-side of the internet. Providing applications
for the client and responsible for the data requested by the client or user. The Application
Layer has protocols such as HTTP, IMSP. The data transmitted from the application layer is 
named as a 'message'.

Transport Layer:
The transport layer is responsible for transporting data between either a client and a server, or
between peers (P2P transmission). The transport layer takes the message from the application
layer, adds the necessary headers to it (which the transport layer on the receiving end of the
transmission will use), and send the 'segment' (name for the data in the transport layer) to the
next layer, the network layer. 

Network layer:
The network layer will do the same as the transport layer, in adding headers to the data being
transmitted; only in the network layer the data is named a 'datagram'. The network layer will
either use TCP or UDP to transmit the data to the destinantion. There are protocols in place
for transmitting the data, and the relability of if the data is transmitted to the correct 
destinantion is depending on the protocol used to transmit the data. TCP will always deliver
relability in transmitting the data to the correct destinantion using a 4-tuple for resourse
and destination, while UDP will send the data to the destinantion depending on the Port named
in the headers of the datagram. 

Link layer:
The link layer is what links the resourse or host with the destination of server. The client
sends a request to the server, and the link layer is responsible for having a link between
the client and the server. 

Physical layer:
This layer is where the data is physical transmitted, through wires like copper or fiber.
The Physical layer is intertwined with the link layer. 


## T1.2
A communication protocol is a blueprint for how communication is done between two hosts,
could be a server and a client, or two peers. The protocol shows how they communicate with
each other for each communication that is done. That could be that a connection is initialized
by the sender, the receiver accepts the connection, and then data is transmitted between 
the two. Different sorts of communication protocols are:
1. TCP
2. UDp
3. IMSP (Mail service)
4. HTTP


## T1.3
The network edge is the end-system of a internet. This is usually a client or a host. A computer
for example requesting a IP address from the DNS system is a edge of the network. 

Access network is where hosts can connect to the internet. This is usually a router or a wireless
connection connected to a router.

The network core is bla bla bla


## T2.1
The Domain Name System is the system responisble for that both clients (humans) and the
server can understand IP addresses. The DNS system is responsible for ensuring that the 
correct IP address is used. 

The DNS system is a distributed database with different layers:
1. The Root layer
2. The Top level domain
3. The Authoriative

The different layers have responsibility for different domains, like .org, .com, .net etc. 
There is usually a local DNS server where IP addresses could be cached. For example, if your
friend searched for google.com and you then also searches for google.com 5 minutes later, 
the IP address for google.com is probably cached in the local DNS server and you will have
a quick response to your request to open the google.com IP address. If google.com is not 
cached in the local DNS server, the request will go through the layers of the DNS system to 
get a response to the request, starting with the authoriative layer going upwards until the
request is resolved. 


## T2.2
A datagram is the data structured used in the Network layer of the internet. It is probably
a in a IPV4 format, being a 32-bit address containing information about the data being
transmitted. The datagram firstly has a some bytes telling about what version it is, describing
what kind of protocol is used. Then there are headers from all the different layers in the
internet stack. NOKKA MER, Æ HUSKE IKKE
The different information can be understood from the different integers in a IP address.
A IP addres usually looks something like this:
192.62.190.2
Each integer has some data that can be translated to bits, showcasing the information in the
IP address.


## T2.3
Multiplexing is the concept that different processes in one system each sends a file, all 
these files are put together to one payload before being transmitted to the destination. 
When the payload is received at the destiantion, the demultiplexing starts; fragmenting the 
files from the payload to it's original form and send to the desired process in the
receiver end. 



## T3.1
Forwarding in the network layer is when a datagram is received at the input link and is 
transmitted to the appropriate output link in the router. This could be done wither via
network, via bus or via interconnected networks. 

Routing is the concept of transmitting a datagram from one router to another. Routing
determines the route or path the packet should take between the sender and receiver.


## T3.2
IP datagram fragmentation is when a payload is fragmented into smaller parts, making the
transmission process easier. If you want to send 128 bytes of data, it's easier to send
2 bytes at a time, than sending the whole 128 bytes at one time. The reassembly of the 
fragments are done when all the data is received at the destination IP address. 



## T4.1
Flow control is assuring that packets are not roaming the internet forever if it isn't
received at the destination it's supposed to. Each packet has a TTL(Time To Live) which decreases
each time the packet is trhough a router or a link. When the TTL reaches 0, the packet is dropped, 
ensuring that the packet can't roam free through the internet. This is controlling that the 
flow of packet is not overflowed. 

Congestion control is controlling that packets are not being sent to the link layer too quickly.
If there are more packets being sent then packets being transmitted, you need to store the packets
somewhere. There are usually a buffer where the packets can be stored. If this buffer fills up, 
the packets are lost. This buffer is controlling that no more data is being sent then can be 
transmitted.
